          <p class="text-indent">My name is Diego Andrade, and I was born and raised in Northern California. In essence,
            I am a curious, inquisitive, ambitious, and social individual who firmly believes that the most valuable
            things in life are the experiences we embrace and the meaningful connections we foster with others. As I
            step into this new chapter of my life armed with a degree in Computer Engineering, I am driven to pursue a
            fulfilling career where I can make a meaningful impact. With my insatiable curiosity and passion for
            technology, I am determined to contribute to the advancement of the digital age and its potential to improve
            the lives of people worldwide. Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, I aspire to be a part of
            the transformative changes that will shape a brighter future for generations to come.
          </p><br>
          <p class="text-indent">From a young age, my inquisitive nature often led me to get into trouble. I was
            incredibly curious, always eager to be in the middle of the action. I frequently asked my parents questions,
            genuinely interested in understanding what they were doing and the reasons behind it. I also couldn't resist
            tinkering, disassembling, and sometimes breaking things to uncover their inner workings. As you can imagine,
            this didn't always sit well with my parents. I especially held a deep fascination for mechanical toys,
            especially robots, cars, and helicopters (i.e. Air Hogs), which unfortunately my parents couldn't afford.
            One day, when I was 12 years old, I stumbled upon a cheap computer at a yard sale. I pleaded with my parents
            to get it, and to my surprise, they actually did! I was finally given a computer of my own, a possession I
            cherished greatly and made uniquely mine. The world of computers opened up before me, and I plunged deep
            into exploring their capabilities.

          </div>
          <p class="text-indent">One of my earliest endeavors with my newly acquired computer was delving into the world
            of Minecraft. Its open-world sandbox nature captivated me, offering endless possibilities to unleash my
            creativity. In particular, I found myself deeply fascinated with constructing bases, agricultural farms, and
            mob farms. Moreover, Minecraft incorporates a surprisingly simple yet complex mechanism similar to that of
            electrical circuits, which enables players to add dynamics and environment responsiveness to their
            creations. For instance, one could create elevators, intricate automated doors, or automated farm
            harvesters, to name a few. I learned all sorts of things about Minecraft circuits, such as actuators, logic
            gates, and sensors. Eventually, my learning journey led me to mods, which expanded Minecraft's creation
            capabilities. One mod, in particular, caught my attention: Computercraft. This mod allowed players to build
            in-game robots programmable with LUA, to perform various tasks. I taught myself how to program in LUA in
            order to create automated tree farmers, quarry miners, and much more with these robots. The joy I
            experienced while programming these virtual robots was undeniable, and it was from that moment on, I knew I
            wanted to pursue a career in programming and electronics.

            The next significant milestone in my life occurred during the second half of my junior year when I
            discovered that my school had a FIRST Robotics team and offered a robotics elective course! It was my first
            time ever learning that such a program existed. Without hesitation, I eagerly signed up for the class series
            and started attending the after-school meetings. I dedicated considerable effort and time to the team,
            spending many late afternoons at school, immersing myself in learning everything about robots and assisting
            with any tasks that needed to be done. Before long, I had acquired the skills necessary to take charge of
            programming the robot, eventually becoming the main programmer. It turned out to be a remarkable journey as
            our robotics team qualified for the championships in Houston, TX. Although we didn't make it to the finals
            at Worlds, the experience was truly invaluable. Being a part of the team taught me the essence of teamwork
            and how to thrive under pressure during competitions. Moreover, it provided me with the opportunity to forge
            deep and lasting friendships, some of which continue to be my best friends to this day, and for many more
            years to come. Additionally, this experience further solidified my determination to pursue a career as a
            Computer Engineer.

            In December 2022, I proudly graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering, ready to embark
            on a new chapter in my life. My time at Cal Poly has left an indelible mark, shaping me into the person and
            professional I am today. The memories, friendships, and the invaluable "Learn by Doing" experience will
            forever influence my path ahead, as I look forward to making a meaningful impact in the world of technology
            and engineering.

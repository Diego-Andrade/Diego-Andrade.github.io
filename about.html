        <p class="text-indent">My name is Diego Andrade, and I was born and raised in Northern California. In essence, I
          am a curious, inquisitive, ambitious, and social individual who firmly believes that the most valuable things
          in life are the experiences we embrace and the meaningful connections we foster with others. As I step into
          this new chapter of my life armed with a degree in Computer Engineering, I am driven to pursue a fulfilling
          career where I can make a meaningful impact. With my insatiable curiosity and passion for technology, I am
          determined to contribute to the advancement of the digital age and its potential to improve the lives of
          people worldwide. Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, I aspire to be a part of the
          transformative changes that will shape a brighter future for generations to come.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text-indent">From a young age, my inquisitive nature often led me to get into trouble. I was
          incredibly curious, always eager to be in the middle of the action. I frequently asked my parents questions,
          genuinely interested in understanding what they were doing and the reasons behind it. I also couldn't resist
          tinkering, disassembling,and sometimes breaking things to uncover their inner workings. As you can imagine,
          this didn't always sit well with my parents. I especially held a deep fascination for mechanical toys,
          especially robots, cars, and helicopters (i.e. Air Hogs), which unfortunately my parents couldn't afford. One
          day, when I was 12 years old, I stumbled upon a cheap computer at a yard sale. I pleaded with my parents to
          get it, and to my surprise, they actually did! I was finally given a computer of my own, a possession I
          cherished greatly and made uniquely mine. The world of computers opened up before me, and I delved deep into
          their capabilities.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text-indent">One of my earliest endeavors with my newly acquired computer was delving into the world
          of Minecraft. Its open-world sandbox nature captivated me, offering endless possibilities to unleash my
          creativity. In particular, I found myself deeply fascinated with constructing bases, agricultural farms, and
          mob farms. Moreover, Minecraft incorporates a surprisingly simple yet complex mechanism similar to that of
          electrical circuits, which enables players to add dynamics and environment responsiveness to their creations.
          For instance, one could create elevators, intricate automated doors, or automated farm harvesters, to name a
          few. I learned all sorts of things about Minecraft circuits, such as actuators, logic gates, and sensors.
          Eventually, my learning journey led me to mods, which expanded Minecraft's creation capabilities. One mod, in
          particular, caught my attention: Computercraft. This mod allowed players to build in-game robots programmable
          with LUA, to perform various tasks. I taught myself how to program in LUA in order to create automated tree
          farmers, quarry miners, and much more with these robots. The joy I experienced while programming these virtual
          robots was undeniable, and it was from that moment on, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in programming and
          electronics.

          The next significant milestone in my life occurred during the second half of my junior
          year when I discovered that my school had a FIRST Robotics team and offered a robotics elective course! It was
          my first time ever learning that such a program existed. Without hesitation, I eagerly signed up for the class
          series and started attending the after-school meetings. I dedicated considerable effort and time to the team,
          spending many late afternoons at school, immersing myself in learning everything about robots and assisting
          with any tasks that needed to be done. Before long, I had acquired the skills necessary to take charge of
          programming the robot, eventually becoming the main programmer. It turned out to be a remarkable journey as
          our robotics team qualified for the championships in Houston, TX. Although we didn't make it to the finals at
          Worlds, the experience was truly invaluable. Being a part of the team taught me the essence of teamwork and
          how to thrive under pressure during competitions. Moreover, it provided me with the opportunity to forge deep
          and lasting friendships, some of which continue to be my best friends to this day, and for many more years to
          come. Additionally, this experience further solidified my determination to pursue a career as a Computer
          Engineer.

          While engineering and electronics are a big part of my life, I strongly believe in maintaining a healthy
          work-life balance. It's essential to engage in activities that nurture both the mind and soul. For me, that
          means spending quality time with friends, whether we're hiking, backpacking, or simply enjoying a relaxing day
          at home playing games. Additionally, I have a deep passion for exploring new places and embarking on
          adventures with my cherished family and friends. There's an entire world waiting to be discovered, and I'm
          eager to continue this journey of exploration and shared experiences.
